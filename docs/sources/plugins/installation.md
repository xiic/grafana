# Plugins

## Installing plugins

The easiest way to install plugins is by using the CLI tool grafana-cli which is bundled with grafana. Before any modification take place after modifying plugins, grafana-server needs to be restarted.

### Grafana plugin directory
On Linux systems the grafana-cli will assume that the grafana plugin directory is "/var/lib/grafana/plugins". It's possible to override the directory which grafana-cli will operate on by specifing the --path flag. On Windows systems this parameter have to be specified for every call.

### Grafana-cli commands

List available plugins
```
grafana-cli list-remote
```

Install a plugin type
```
grafana-cli install <plugin-id>
```

List installed plugins
```
grafana-cli ls
```

Upgrade all installed plugins
```
grafana-cli upgrade-all
```

Upgrade one plugin
```
grafana-cli upgrade <plugin-id>
```

Remove one plugin
```
grafana-cli remove <plugin-id>
```
